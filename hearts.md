Deck: standard 52 card deck. No jokers. To play with 5 players, set aside the
3 of Clubs and 3 of Spades.

Setup: deal all the cards face down. Each player should have 13 for a 4 person game, or 10 for
a 5 person game. Players may look at their cards, but should not reveal them to anyone else.

Gameplay:

Like other trick taking games, players take turns in the seated order, each playing
a single card on their turn, face up in the center. Once every player has played
a card, that constitues a "trick." Each trick has a winner, as explained below. The
winner takes the cards from the center and places them to the side, face down. These
cards will be used later to determine the score. The winner starts the next trick.
Continue in this manner until all the cards have been played.

How do you win a trick?

The winner of a trick is the player who played the highest card of the leading suit.
The leading suit means the suit of the card that was played first in the trick.
Note that often it's actually a bad thing to win a trick (see objective).

Examples:

TODO

What cards are you allowed to play on your turn?

If you're going first...

You may play any card, except a heart, unless hearts are broken.

If the trick has already been started...

You must play a card of the leading suit (i.e. you must "follow suit"), unless you
have none of those. If  you're out of the leading suit (termed a "vacancy"), you may play any card.
This can be a good chance to get rid of a "bad" card (see objective and strategy).
If you don't follow suit when you should have (and players will notice because
eventually all your cards will be played), then you lose. (When playing with new players,
it can be a good idea to double check that they're out of the leading suit when they play
a card that's not the leading suit and give them a chance to undo their mistake.)

Remember that the leading suit is defined by the first card played in the trick, which
is not always the same suit as the one that is played before your turn.

How do you break hearts?

Hearts are broken when any player who can't follow suit decides to play a heart.
After this, players are allowed to start a trick with a heart.

Scoring:

After the game ends, take the cards from the tricks that you won and
tally up the number of hearts (one point per heart). If you got the
Queen of Spades add 13 points.

Objective:

Get the least number of points (i.e. no or few hearts and no Queen of Spades) OR
get _all_ the points (i.e. win all 13 hearts and the Queen of Spades). This latter
winning condition is called Shooting the Moon.

It can be fun to keep a running score
going and play a few rounds. This helps distribute unlucky hands around the table.
If you're keeping score this way and someone shoots the moon, give them 0 points
and 26 to everyone else.

Who goes first?

To start the first trick, the player with the 2 of clubs begins.


Strategies:

Shooting the Moon: this is a risky bet. If you miss even by one heart, you'll
wind up with 25 points. And, if players catch on that you're trying to shoot the
moon, they may be willing to sacrifice winning a heart or two just to prevent you
from succeeding. To pull it off, you'll typically need a good number of hearts
and some real firepower in at least one suit. Towards the end of the game, it helps
to be long in one suit where you have most or all of the highest cards. This way
you can take control and not give it up until you've won all the cards.

The Queen of Spades:

Don't forget about the Queen of Spades! It's the worst card in the game.
be very careful about playing the King or Ace of Spades. If you have
been dealt the Queen, try to keep at least one other spade in hand
so that you're not forced to play the Queen in a situation where you
would win the trick.

Laying Low:

This is often the best strategy, especially for beginners. Try not to win
any tricks. If you don't win any, you don't pick up any hearts. As you play,
try to create a vacancy in one suit. Then focus on playing your highest cards
in scenarios where you won't win the trick (either because you're out of the
leading suit, or someone has already played a higher card of the leading suit).
Make sure to get rid of your high hearts first, then the high cards of other suits.

Twists and Variations:

1. Passing cards:

After dealing the cards, each player picks three cards to pass to the player
to their left. Which three you pick depend on your strategy. You might want to
create a vacancy, get rid of high cards (especially high spades!), get rid of
hearts, or maybe increase your chances of being able to shoot the moon. For the next
round, pass the three cards to the right. Round 3, pass across the table. Then for the
last round, everyone keeps their cards.

2. Diamonds are positive

When tallying scores at the end, count each diamond as +1 and each heart as -1.
The goal is now to win the most amount of points.
This can create some interesting gameplay since there is now more of an incentive
to win tricks. (Laying low doesn't work as well when your opponents are raking in
the diamonds.) This variation also provides a bit more cover for moon-shooters--are
they controlling the game because they want all the hearts or because they want
all the diamonds?

3. No being mean in the first trick

Even if someone is out of clubs during the first trick (clubs always leads the first trick),
they are not allowed to "be mean" by playing a heart or the Queen of Spades.


How to teach your friends

I find that people learn best by learning as they play. No one wants to have
an entire instruction manual read to them for 15 minutes. The downside of this
approach is that sometimes it can seem like you're just making up the rules
as you go. C'est la vie.

1. Deal the cards
2. Explain that it's a turn based game and that you'll help explain
what everyone is allowed to do on their turn.
3. Explain that the goal of the game is to not get any hearts or the Queen of Spades.
4. Emphasize that you don't want to get the Queen of Spades. I like to invent some terrible
misdeed that the Queen committed that would make you want to avoid her, e.g. the Queen won't say
where she was on January 6th, or she's a duplicitous Gemini, or she doesn't support \_\_\_\_.
5. Make sure everyone knows that aces are high.
6. Invite the player with the 2 of Clubs to start the game by placing it in the center of the table.
7. Tell the next player that they must play a club, any club, if they have one. If they don't have one,
they may play something else.
8. And so on until the first trick is done.
9. Explain who won the trick and why. Explain that if anyone had played hearts, then the winner
of the trick would have gotten those points, which are bad.
10. Invite the winner of the trick to start the next one. Explain that they may play any
card except for a heart (assuming hearts haven't been broken).
11. And so on.
12. When a spade is played, remind everyone about the Queen and her wicked ways.
13. When hearts are broken, announce that it has happened and what it means.
14. At some point, introduce Shooting the Moon. If one player is losing pretty badly,
it could be a good opportunity to explain that they can still win, that all hope is not
lost, etc. Otherwise, maybe save this rule for after the first round.

During the practice round, focus mostly on the mechanics of the game, leaving players to
pick up strategies on their own. Only introduce the card passing or diamond variations
after everyone seems to have a general idea of how to play.
